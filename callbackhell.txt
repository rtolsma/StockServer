Callback hell rehabilitation plan

GET REQUEST:
The webapp submits a get request to NodeExpress to get new data.

Two options here: 
1. Just toss whatever data is currently in the database

--simply reply with a getRange...may be empty
--if it's empty (table doesn't exist, none within time range) then retrieve new data...
--if it's still empty, return empty array indicating faulty timeline

check if service exists (by using timer variables) if not then actively scrape for it

2. Actively scrape new data and display it
--Call the scraper once, insert into database, and then getrange, and then
write the results to page response



The get request should start a Dataservice for that ticker and update the database.


GETRANGE MONGODB:
Needs to accept a callback to execute at the end of the the toArray function.
Otherwise the function doesn't return anything since it's asynchronous

GETDATA Scraper:

Needs a callback to define what to do with the data once it's been succesfully
retrieved and parsed.

All DBCLIENT Methods:
	Should accept a callback parameter to execute on completion--may default to null

DATA SERVICE:
Meant to run async to all other processes
Most tables will be outdated/new so need to accept Callback function to execute on initial database creation, and filling
